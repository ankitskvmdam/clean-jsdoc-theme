`clean-jsdoc-theme` is a beautifully crafted theme for JSDoc 3/JSDoc 4. It is a clean and fully responsive theme with loads of
customisation features.

Some salient features:

1. It supports most screens, i.e. desktops, laptops, iPad and mobile devices.
2. It has a premium-looking dark and light theme.
3. It minifies all the output HTML files (this helps in saving a few KBs).
4. It has search support. The search feature doesn't increase the size of output HTML files.
5. It is regularly updated.
6. It is highly
   performant.

## Installation

> Note : you must have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine.

In a terminal, type :

```bash
npm install clean-jsdoc-theme --save-dev
# or
yarn add clean-jsdoc-theme -D
```

In your projects `package.json` file, add a script to generate the documentation using JSDoc :

```json
"scripts": {
  "generate-docs": "jsdoc --configure jsdoc.json --verbose"
}
```

> Heads Up! In the above `generate_docs` script, the value of the `--configure` option is `jsdoc.json`. Make sure
> the `jsdoc.json` file exists as it contains the JSDoc configuration. If you have your JSDoc config in a different
> file,
> replace `jsdoc.json` with its name.

In your `jsdoc.json` file, add a template option to use `clean-jsdoc-theme` instead of the default JSDoc theme:

```json
"opts": {
  "template": "node_modules/clean-jsdoc-theme"
}
```

Now, run the previously added script to generate the documentation :

```bash
npm run generate-docs
```

For more information, look at the [clean-jsdoc-theme-example](https://github.com/ankitskvmdam/clean-jsdoc-theme-example)
repository.

## Example JSDoc Config

```json
{
    "source": {
        "include": ["lib", "package.json", "README.md"],
        "includePattern": ".js$",
        "excludePattern": "(node_modules/|docs)"
    },
    "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"],
    "opts": {
        "encoding": "utf8",
        "readme": "./README.md",
        "destination": "docs/",
        "recurse": true,
        "verbose": true,
        "template": "./node_modules/clean-jsdoc-theme",
        "theme_opts": {
            "default_theme": "dark"
        }
    },
    "markdown": {
        "hardwrap": false,
        "idInHeadings": true
        // This is important for clean-jsdoc-theme, otherwise some features might not work.
    }
}
```

## Options

### Set a default theme

To set the default theme, add the following in your JSDoc config file:

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "default_theme": "dark" // "light", "fallback-dark", "fallback-light"
}
```

If you set default theme as `"fallback-dark"`, then `clean-jsdoc-theme` will try to detect user's preferred color scheme. If it will detect successfully then it will set user's preferred theme else fallback to dark theme.

Same if you set default theme as `"fallback-light"`, it will try to detect user's preferred theme. If not then fallback to light theme.

### Set base url

To set the base url, add the following in your JSDoc config file:

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "base_url": "https://ankdev.me/v4/"
}
```

> Make sure to add a forward slash (`/`) at the end of the URL.

The default value of `base_url` is computed with the following code:

```js
const path = document.location.pathname;
const baseURL = path.substr(0, path.lastIndexOf('/') + 1);
```

### Add favicon

To set a favicon, add the following in your JSDoc config file:

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "favicon": "path/to/img"
}
```

You can use [`static_dir`](#add-static-dir) option to copy all you static files to output dir and use that path instead
of `path/to/img`. This will not flatten the output file path, it will preserve the directory structure. If you want to
flatten the output dir use jsdoc default [copy static files options](https://jsdoc.app/about-configuring-default-template.html)

### Add homepage title

To add the title of the homepage use the `homepageTitle` property as follows:

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "homepageTitle": "Clean JSDoc theme"
}
```

### Add title

Both strings and HTML are accepted. Use HTML to overwrite the default HTML, and a string to set a plaintext title. One
example of this is below:

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "title": "<img src='path/to/img' class='my-custom-class'/>" // or "title": "clean-jsodc-theme"
}
```

You can use [`static_dir`](#add-static-dir) option to copy all you static files to output dir and use that path in place
of `path/to/img`.

### Add files list in homepage

By default `clean-jsdoc-theme` will not include the list of files in the homepage. If you want to add them the do the following

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "includeFilesListInHomepage": true // by default it is false.
}
```

> Note: You need to add @file tag in the .js if you want to include it in the file list. For more details on `@file` visit: https://jsdoc.app/tags-file.html

### Add navbar menu

To render extra link(s) in navbar. It accepts an array of objects:

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "menu": [
    {
      "title": "Website",
      "link": "https://ankdev.me/clean-jsdoc-theme/dark/",
      "target": "_blank",
      "class": "some-class",
      "id": "some-id"
    },
    {
      // more if you want to.
    }
  ]
}
```

`menu` is an array of objects. Each object has five properties, out of which two are required (`title` and `link`). If
an object doesn't have the required properties, then you might expect an error.

<b>Properties</b>

| name     | type     | required |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `title`  | `string` | required |
| `link`   | `string` | required |
| `target` | `string` | optional |
| `class`  | `string` | optional |
| `id`     | `string` | optional |

### Sections

There is also an option to add a meta tag to every generated HTML file. You can use the `meta` option to include a list
of `meta` tags into `head`.

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "sections": ["Classes", "Modules", "Global"] // Only three members will be in the sidebar.
}
```

```js
// SECTION_TYPE
[
    'Classes',
    'Modules',
    'Externals',
    'Events',
    'Namespaces',
    'Mixins',
    'Tutorials',
    'Interfaces',
    'Global'
];
```

### Meta

There is also an option to add meta tag to every generated HTML file. You can use `meta` option to include a list
of `meta` tags into `head`.

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "meta": [
    {
      "name": "author",
      "content": "Ankit Kumar"
    },
    {
      "name": "description",
      "content": "Best Clean and minimal JSDoc 3 Template/Theme"
    }
  ]
}
```

`meta` is an array of objects. Each objects can have any valid combination
of [HTML metadata attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#Attributes).

### Search

By default, the search feature is enabled in the theme.

> Make sure you have added the `base_url` option as well, otherwise your search query might fail.
>
> If you want to disable the search feature, you can do the following:

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "search": false
}
```

**How does the search work?**

If the search feature is enabled, you'll see a `data` folder in the output. This `data` folder contains a JSON
called `search.json`. There is a fetch request when user types anything in the search box. That means search data is
only loaded if user wants to search anything.

### CodePen

> Note: currently, this feature is only enabled for the examples section.

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "codepen": {
    "enable_for": ["examples"],
    "options": {
      "js_external": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js",
      "js_pre_processor": "babel"
    }
  }
}
```

`options` can be any valid CodePen option. For more
visit: [Codepen Prefill options](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/prefill/#all-the-json-options-0)

If you want to add some js in the beginning of your example then you can use `js` option.

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "codepen": {
    "enable_for": ["examples"],
    "options": {
      "js_external": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js",
      "js_pre_processor": "babel"
      "js": "import Something from 'some-package'"
    }
  }
}
```

Let say you have an example as follows:

```js
/**
 * @example
 * let a = Something.fn()
 * console.log(a) // Return value of something
 */
const a;
```

In codepen the above `@example` will look like:

```js
import Something from 'some-package';

let a = Something.fn();
console.log(a); // Return value of something
```

### Add static dir

To include static files:

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "static_dir": ["./static"],
}
```

### Add styles

To create custom style rules. Example:

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "create_style": ".sidebar-title { font-size: 2rem }"
}
```

### Add style paths

Use this option to add third party css library. If you want to add your own custom css file then consider
using [Add custom css files](#add-custom-css-files)

> Note: you have to pass an array of objects. Each object key will be an attribute inside the generated style tag.

Example:

```json
"add_style_path": [
  {
    "href": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
    "integrity": "sha384-giJF6kkoqNQ00vy+HMDP7azOuL0xtbfIcaT9wjKHr8RbDVddVHyTfAAsrekwKmP1",
    "crossorigin": "anonymous"
  }
],
```

### Add custom css files

To include css files. Example:

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "include_css": ["./static/index.css", "./src/docs/index.css"]
}
```

> Note: you are not required to manually copy file to output dir.

It will include the css files to the output dir and also attach a link tag to the html pointing to the included css
file.

### Add scripts

If you wish to incorporate JavaScript functions that execute when a user accesses a webpage, you can utilize the add_scripts option for this purpose. For instance, suppose you want to display a notification dialog when a user visits the webpage located at https://place-where-my-docs-are/SomeClass.html. You want to notify users that they should refrain from utilizing this class. To accomplish this, you can proceed as follows:

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "add_scripts": "function showAlert(){ if (window.location.pathname === '/SomeClass.html') { alert('Do not use this class') } } showAlert();",
}
```

Writing js code like above can get tricky and complex. You can consider `include_js`.

### Add script paths

Use this option to add third party js library. If you want to add your own custom script file then consider
using [Add custom script files](#add-custom-script-files)

> Note: you have to pass an array of objects, and object keys are actually the attributes which you want in you script
> tag.

Example:

```json
"add_script_path": [
  {
    "href": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.js",
    "integrity": "sha256-QWo7LDvxbWT2tbbQ97B53yJnYU3WhH/C8ycbRAkjPDc=",
    "crossorigin": "anonymous"
  }
],
```

This will copy the static folder to the output dir.

> Note: if the directory doesn't exist then you may get an error. Also, directory is relative to your jsdoc config file.

This will not flatten the directory. Directory structure will be kept as it is.

### Add custom script files

If you wish to run some local/custom javascript then you can include them via `include_js`.

Lets say you want to show some custom message depending on url. You can create a js file as follows:

```js
// static/showAlert.js
function showCustomAlertMessage() {
    const pathname = window.location.pathname;

    switch (pathname) {
        case '/SomeClass.html':
            return alert("Please don't use this class");
        case '/OtherPage.html':
            return alert('Wonderful!');
        default:
            return;
    }
}

showCustomAlert();
```

Assuming the above js file is stored in `./static/showAlert.js`. To include you can do:

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "include_js": ["./static/showAlert.js"]
}
```

> Note: you are not required to manually copy file to output dir.

It will include the js files to the output dir and also attach a script tag to the html pointing to the included js
file.

If you want to add some script for some pages then you can do the following:

```json
"include_js": [
    "./demo/src/assets/script.js",
    {
        "filepath": "./demo/src/assets/random.js",
        "targets": [
            "MyClass",
            "tutorial-MyClassTutorial"
        ]
    }
],
```

Here target is the name of the generated html file (don't include `.html`).

The above config will add `./demo/src/assets/script.js` to all the generated html files. However, it will
add `./demo/src/assets/random.js` only to `MyClass.html` and `tutorial-MyClassTutorial.html` files.

The file name of the generated html generally follows the following convention:

-   Class: class's name + `.html`. Ex `Alive.html`
-   Module: `module-` + module's name + `.html`. Ex: `module-SqlJs.html`
-   Tutorials: `tutorial-` + tutorial's filename + `.html`

If you are not sure about the target name, then generate html for the first time, then look at the urls.

### To ignore sorting

To ignore the sorting of members/methods/event in the page. If it is `false` then the order of
members/methods/events will be in the order they are in code/source.

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "sort": false
}
```

### Footer

```json
"theme_opts": {
  "footer": "This is footer" // or <div class="footer-wrapper">This is a footer </div>
}
```

### To exclude inherited

To exclude inherited symbols. Example:

```json
"exclude_inherited": true
```

This will remove all symbols (members, methods ...) that come from inherited parents.

Don't forget to add the following in your jsdoc config file, otherwise toc will not work on some pages.

```json
"markdown": {
  "idInHeadings": true // This is important for clean-jsdoc-theme, otherwise some features might not work.
}
```
